      This website assists with learning what the purposes of some punctuation marks are. I must caveat this by saying that these are not the only uses of these punctuation marks, but some very general uses that should suffice to help one learn enough about how to apply them.

    <article id="commas">
      <h1>Commas</h1>
      <p>
        Commas are used before coordinating conjunctions that introduce an independent clause. 
But what the heck does that even mean?! To break it down, a coordinating conjunction is a word that is able to piece together two different pieces of sentences, like a piece of tape holding two thoughts together. Keep in mind the acronym “FANBOYS.” This stands for the following: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, and So. They are able to piece together two parts of a sentence, such as the example below.
“I had already eaten, but Grandma insisted I have dessert.”
The following parts form two complete sentences, but the addition of the comma and the coordinating conjunction allows the two sentences to become one.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also use commas after most introductory phrases and clauses, as you’ve seen (even in this sentence!) in the paper already. 
      </p>

      <p>
          Another reason to use a comma is after a conjunctive adverb. Examples of these are “however”, “moreover,”  and “therefore”. An example of this is:
          “Jonathan had finished his homework, however, he hadn’t turned it in.”          
      </p>

      <p>
          Commas are also used in lists to separate items. Used correctly, the list should appear as such:
          “Momma had asked for eggs, milk, bread, and cheese.”          
      </p>

      <p>
          This is also used with appositives, sentences usually used for clarifying an idea in a sentence. Used it is as follows:
          “Jason, my best friend, is on the drumline for this season.
        </p>
    </article>
    
    <article id="semicolons">
      <h1>Semicolons</h1>
      <p>
          You would use a semicolon between a conjunctive adverb to show relationship between two full sentences. Earlier, in commas, we went over how you would put commas after a conjunctive adverb. However, in this case, it would act like the comma in a coordinating conjunction, going before the adverb. Used, it looks like this:
          “I was going to make a sandwich; however, I realized we had leftover lasagna in the fridge.”
      </p>

      <p>
          Another reason to use the semicolon is to connect two full sentences what are closely related. It is used as such:
          “On my way to class, it started raining; I ended up wet and cold.”
      </p>

      <p>
          This is also used between lists containing commas. For example, it is used like this:
          “She had made her lunch; Chips, Potato Salad, a Baked Potato, and fries.”          
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article id="colons">
      <h1>Colons</h1>
      <p>
          Throughout this website, you’ve likely noticed these two dot thingies after a lot of sentences. These are called colons. These are used to introduce examples if there are full sentences before them. You’ve seen me use them quite a few times, so there’s no need for an example of this one. A colon is also used before a list. This is used like this:
          “I had three board games in my closet: Monopoly, Risk, and Battleships.”
      </p>

      <p>
          A colon is also used to introduce a quote. This can only be done if there is there is a full sentence before it. This can be used as such:
          “I enjoy Albert Einstein’s quote about insanity:”Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article id=ellipses>
      <h1>Ellipses</h1>
      <p>
          You ever see those three dots in a row next to each other? Those are called ellipses. These are usually used to make a break in a sentence, or so show words have been omitted from the sentence. Used, these dots look like this:
          “Markus felt he had done the right thing, but then again…”
          Or in the middle of a sentence, they appear as such:
          “Markus felt he had done the right thing… but couldn’t be sure.”
      </p>
    </article>

    <article id="dashes-hyphens">
      <h1>Dashes and Hyphens</h1>
      <p>This next one is going to be confusing. Whenever you see those little lines in between words, they can be either of two things; a dash or a hyphen.They look so similar in writing but have very different purposes. On a computer, a dash is usually signified by placing two hyphens in a row. While dashes are usually used to separate ideas, hyphens are meant to join words. More in depth below.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article id=dashes>
      <h1>Dashes</h1>
      <p>
          Dashes are used to show a sudden break in thought. Something to note is that when a dash is at the end of a sentence, omit the ending punctuation mark.
          “He began, ‘May I ask--’”          
      </p>

      <p>
          They are also used to set off a parenthetical element. That sounds confusing, so I’ll break it down a bit more. A parenthetical element is a few words that interrupts the sentence to add a bit of information that may not be needed, but still adds to the piece. In practice, it appears as such:
          “I ran down the street--by the coffee shop--and found ten dollars on the ground.”          
      </p>

      <p>
          They can also be used to emphasize an appositive. We touched on those in commas, so here they are in practice:
          “My classes this year--Chemistry, English, and Biology-- are all very difficult.”          
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article id="hyphens">
      <h1>Hyphens</h1>
      <p>
          Hyphens, on the other hand, are used for joining things. They are used to join compound words, like “mother-in-law.” They are also used to join words to form a single adjective before a noun, as in “coffee-fueled project.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTpXh33Mbeg">But wait, there’s more!</a>  They’re also used with compound numbers, such as in “forty-five” or with fractions, “two-fifths.” Not only that, but with compound adjectives with numbers, such as “two-story house” or “five-star hotel.” Hyphens are also used with certain prefixes and suffixes. These are “ex-”, “self-”, “all-”, and with the suffix “-elect”. There are also some special cases, such as “semi-”, where the word is only used when followed by an i, or a proper noun, as seen in “semi-American,” or “semi-intelligent.” Un is hyphenated in un-American. A hyphen is also used to indicate hesitation or stuttering, or spelling out words. Famous examples of this are: “Z-Z-Z-Zoinks, Scoob! We’re being followed by a g-g-g-g-host!”
          When spelled out, it looks like this: “My dog freaks out whenever I say w-a-l-k.”
